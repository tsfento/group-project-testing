Sally is a co-founder of a recent startup. She is responsible for
HR tasks. The company has decided to use **NAME** for their talent
management. It is the first official day of business and Sally is
logging into **NAME** for the first time. Her first step is to log
in to the app with her credentials. Since it is the first time she
is using the app, she will need to add some employees to the
organization. She clicks the "personnel" link in the sidebar. It 
shows there are no active employees, but there is a link to add
one. After clicking, she is presented with a modal with the basic
information she needs to add an employee to the database. Info
such as, their name, contact information, hire date, title, etc.
She fills out the form and submits it. The modal closes and the
page is updated with the new employee listed. The "add" link is
still there, so she is able to continue to add more employees to
the database.

John is the supervisor for his department. He has an employee,
Tim, who needs to attend a training seminar for the maintenance
software the department uses. John would like to add this
training to Tim's profile in **NAME** for tracking. John is
already logged into **NAME**, so he navigates to the "personnel"
page. By default, John only sees himself and his direct
subordinates. This enables him to quickly manage his department.
He finds Tim's profile link and clicks on it. In the tasks section,
he clicks "add task". A modal is presented for him to fill out the
details of the task to assign. Info like, a name for the task, the
due date, the cost, if any, of the task, etc. He fills it out and
submits it. The modal closes and the task is added to Tim's profile.
Tim can see it when he logs in, and will even be alerted that a new
task is available. It is important to note that John is authorized
to add new tasks to his employees, but the **NAME** admin could be
the one to do this, instead, depending on the needs of the
organization.

Jane is a recent hire to her employer. She has been tasked with
ordering and maintaining the supplies and equipment for her
department. She has a subscription through an office supply chain
for basic necessities, such as paper, pens, etc. She has yet to
receive this months shipment. The subscription was intially set
up with accounts payable, but there has been a role change in that
department, so Jane needs to look up the contact information for
the department. See logs into **NAME** and clicks the "personnel"
link in the sidebar. By default, Jane only sees her department.
She clicks the tab at the top that says "All" and the list is
updated with the entire organization. In the search box at the,
she searches "accounts payable" as she types the list is filtered.
When she finishes typing "accounts", the list is only a couple of
employees and she is easily able to find the one she is looking for.
(Should there be tabs at the top for each department?)
